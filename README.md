# OOSE-Route-Tracker-App
Java app made for exploring patterns and other more complex system structures. Uses a combined strategy and composite pattern to dynamically string 'Point' objects together, which becomes a hiking route made up of checkpoint 'Point' objects. It also uses the observer pattern to fetch data from an external, mocked GPS component when required.
